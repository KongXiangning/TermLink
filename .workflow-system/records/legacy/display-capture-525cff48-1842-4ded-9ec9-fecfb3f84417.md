- TASK-004 closed: ["The four historical Task Store reports C2-store-final, C2-publish, C4-flow-final and C4-unattended are still stale; new current-subject execution evidence is separate and does not rewrite them.","Execution reports are caller-reported summaries without raw stdout attachments; reviews are Codex self-reviews, not independent test execution.","The execution journal's CR and contract hashes predate their final edits; the review separately read and bound the current document hashes.","External Codex host deployment and Android physical-device validation were not performed; no release-readiness claim is made.","No Git commit, push or deployment performed; CR stays draft with commit_ref TBD.","Legacy CURRENT_TASK/task-store projection was not reconciled and may still show Task 004 active/S3 ready."]

- issue-ec19a134aefeb23287cb519b: Review must identify its real draft or effective execution target, without inventing a clean receipt.
- Recover with task rebuild/link/correct/resolve/defer. Rebuilding never reruns business commands.
