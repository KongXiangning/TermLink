## Review, execution and remaining work
- TASK-004 closed: ["The four historical Task Store reports C2-store-final, C2-publish, C4-flow-final and C4-unattended are still stale; new current-subject execution evidence is separate and does not rewrite them.","Execution reports are caller-reported summaries without raw stdout attachments; reviews are Codex self-reviews, not independent test execution.","The execution journal's CR and contract hashes predate their final edits; the review separately read and bound the current document hashes.","External Codex host deployment and Android physical-device validation were not performed; no release-readiness claim is made.","No Git commit, push or deployment performed; CR stays draft with commit_ref TBD.","Legacy CURRENT_TASK/task-store projection was not reconciled and may still show Task 004 active/S3 ready."]
- TASK-20260830 closed: ["The task is closed as a disposition, not verified product completion or PASS.","The worktree is detached and dirty with in-scope Rust/docs changes plus workflow/runtime records; no Git commit, staging cleanup, push or deployment was performed or authorized.","The latest review is clean only for the exact isolated Rust S3-R3 subject and is a same-agent self-review, not an independent review.","The retained initial real-probe wrapper failure compared 269 derived events with 227 physical records; corrected physical progress assertions passed, but the original failure and script remain retained.","The full Rust library suite, historical Windows nested absolute-path assertion and broad formatting checks were not fully rerun or remain limited.","check-doc-sync remains failed because no active CR with a real commit_ref exists; the S3 CR remains draft/TBD.","Node product canonical publication/database transaction and Android first-page/App ACK or device/host integration remain unverified; Task005 remains paused.","Existing unrelated unassociated management record remains unresolved and state completeness remains partial-associations; stale Task004 reports remain historical.","No rollback, deployment, Task005 resume, or product integration action was performed."]

- Health: needs-attention
- Unassociated observations: 1
- conflict-61ce3846cd76853e1075fe1e: Concurrent alternatives require a specific selection; no last-write-wins.
- issue-ec19a134aefeb23287cb519b: Review must identify its real draft or effective execution target, without inventing a clean receipt.
- Recover with task rebuild/link/correct/resolve/defer. Rebuilding never reruns business commands.
